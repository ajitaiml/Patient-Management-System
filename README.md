## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone the repository, install dependencies, launch the backend and frontend—all in **one go**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajitaiml/Patient-Management-System.git
cd Patient-Management-System
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload  # Launch backend
streamlit run app.py       # Launch frontend

This file now includes:  
- **All sections merged into one flow**  
- **Badges** for Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, GitHub  
- **Quick Start** instructions in a single block  
- **Emojis** for all headings  
- Fully GitHub-ready, professional layout  

If you want, I can **also add a colorful header banner and extra badges** so it looks like a premium GitHub project.  

Do you want me to do that next?
